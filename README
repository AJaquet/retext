This is ReText tarball.

You do not need to compile the source code, it can be interpreted by any Python version (Python 3 support is experimental).

However, you need to compile the locale files if you want to use localized version.
Do it using `lrelease retext_%LANG%.ts` command, where lrelease is from lqt4-dev package and %LANG% is your language (example: retext_ru.ts). This will generate retext_%LANG%.qm file. ReText automatically loads language files if they are placed in its working directory. On Linux systems, /usr/lib/retext/ is the alternate directory.

ReText is licensed under GNU GPL license, which is available in LICENSE_GPL file.
